RuneBot is an opinionated [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com/community) chatbot inspired by [RuneInfo](https://www.runeinfo.xyz).

All the useful RuneInfo commands are implemented, plus some commands to aid clue scroll chasers, Archaeology training, and Invention Perks.

Commands are invoked by @mention or by the bot prefix `.` - The bot prefix is not configurable.

We won't be an all-purpose bot that manages your roles, kicks/bans your users, and eats your lunch. If you want those features, you're welcome to code them yourself.

# Commands
* Full commands list and features [available here](/commands.md).
* We keep some non-identifiable information to make running commands easier. Privacy policy [available here](/privacy.md#user-data).

# Feature Requests/Bug Reports
* Found a bug/ Have a feature request? File a [github issue](https://github.com/VeryLongDelay/RuneBot/issues/new/choose).
